<h1>Before I wish you the happiest birthday, I just want to say how much you mean to me. You bring so much joy, love, and light into my life, and I’m so grateful to have you by my side. Today is special because it’s the day the world was blessed with you. I hope this year brings you endless happiness and everything your heart desires…
